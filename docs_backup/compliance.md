# Compliance

Export controls, ethics, and licensing information. This page provides high-level, public-facing compliance guidance suitable for a GitHub Pages site. It intentionally contains only non-sensitive, non-controlled information.

## Export Controls

- This site does not publish classified or export-controlled technical details.
- Any controlled-technology downloads (if required) should be handled off-site using secure, access-controlled systems.

## Ethics & Responsible Disclosure

- We publish only sanitized, public information. Technical vulnerabilities, safety issues, or sensitive data should be reported via a secure channel (do not open a public issue with technical attachments).

## Licensing & Content

- Where third-party content is used (images, datasheets), ensure appropriate licenses and attributions are present.

## Note on Public Hosting

GitHub Pages is a static public host. Do not store export-controlled material, personally identifiable information (PII), or classified documents in this repository.
